Switch receives two packet streams, h1 sending (adId, impression_time) on
srcPort 11111 and h2 sending (adId, click_time) on srcPort 22222. 
The two streams are joined on adId and the resulting joined packet is
outputed to h3.

	SELECT adId, impression_time, click_time
	FROM impressions i
	INNER JOIN clicks c ON i.adId = c.adId

A click for a particular ad is assumed to occur exactly 1 unit after that ad
was impressed upon the user, but the click packets may arrive out of order.
To mitigate this, each stream can buffer up to 100 packets before the buffer
starts to get overwritten with new packet data.
