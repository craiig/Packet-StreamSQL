/*
 * P4 static joins
 *
 * The switch receives a packet from the stream, joins the packet on 'age' colmumn 
    with static match/action tables containing (age, zip_code) tuples. Output packet is the
    inner join (age, height, weight, name, zip_code)
    
    example: tuples = (int age, int height, int weight, varchar 10 name)
             static_table = (int age, int zip_code)

    SELECT age, height, weight, name, zip_code
    FROM tuples
    INNER JOIN static_table ON tuples.age = static_table.age
    WHERE name = 'alice'

    result = (int age, int height, int weight, varchar 10 name, int zip_code)

 * If an unknown operation is specified or the header is not valid, the packet
 * is dropped
