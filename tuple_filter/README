    The switch receives a packet, filters the packet on 'age' colmumn, applies a project operation,
    and sends packet to destination host
    
    example: tuples = (int age, int height, int weight, varchar 10 name)

    SELECT age, name, count(*)
    FROM tuples
    WHERE age <= 50
    AND name = 'alice'

    result = (int age, varchar 10 name, int count)

    If an unknown operation is specified or the header is not valid, the packet
    is dropped
